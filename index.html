      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p class="flow-text" >After spending 14 years in retail management, Tim has decided to get back to his roots in the tech field. He is currently attending The Coding BootCamp at UNC Chapel Hill. He graduated from ITT Technical Institute in 1998 as valedictorian with an Associate's degree in Electronics Engineering Technology. While there, his hard work and determination earned him membership into the National Technical Honors Society. He used those skills for the next 6 years leading teams in manufacturing research & development.</p>
      <br />
      <p class="flow-text" >Tim and his wife, Erin, recently moved to Durham, NC where they are taking full advantage of expanding his knowledge-base in computers. He strives to figure out how things work and expresses himself through creativity. As a former college athlete, he truly believes in the concept of “team” and looks forward to applying his newly learned skills of HTML, CSS, Javascript, API’s, , Firebase, JQuery, and Node.JS in a great team environment.
