      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p class="flow-text">After spending 14 years in retail management, Tim has decided to get back to his roots in the tech field. He is currently
        attending The Coding BootCamp at UNC Chapel Hill. He graduated from ITT Technical Institute in 1998 as valedictorian
        with an Associate's degree in Electronics Engineering Technology. While there, his hard work and determination earned
        him membership into the National Technical Honors Society. He used those skills for the next 6 years leading teams
        in manufacturing research & development.</p>
      <br />
      <p class="flow-text">Tim and his wife, Erin, recently moved to Durham, NC where they are taking full advantage of expanding his knowledge-base
        in computers. He strives to figure out how things work and expresses himself through creativity. As a former college
        athlete, he truly believes in the concept of “team” and looks forward to applying his newly learned skills of HTML,
        CSS, Javascript, API’s, , Firebase, JQuery, and Node.JS in a great team environment.
